Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

1. I did not consult with any classmates for this assignment
2. I did not attend any sessions, because I didn't have any time this week. In the future, though, I want to go to more office hours
3. I've coded in Java before, but I do prefer it in comparison to Python. Needing to declare variables as specific types is actually very helpful in my brain, because I can keep track of what is supposed to be what.
4. Python seems to be better at smaller programming problems, and Java does well with big programming problems that require a lot of interconnecting parts, but is more tedious when doing smaller problems. I think the conclusion I would draw from this is that if one coding language does not work for one problem, there's probably something out there that has the functionality you want


5. The transcript worked pretty well. The main method automatically called it, but if that was not there I would have just called transcript in the chat method. The hardest part was making sure each of the different mirror words were accurately mirrored. I tried to figure out capitalization and punctuation, but it became very confusing to try and make work. If I had more time I think I would have tried to make a helper function to modify the string in terms of capitalization and punctuation.

My advise: Apparently VS code thinks its smart and will get rid of unused imports for you. This is very annoying because I prefer to write the import and then call the object without errors. You can fix this by unclicking Jdk>Java>On Save> Organize Imports. This means you have to organize them yourself, but you don't have to deal with imports that you are going to use disappearing on you. Also, I wish I had used helper functions to block out my code so I could try and test it better.
